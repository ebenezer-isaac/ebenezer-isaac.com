Collection of Artificial Intelligence Projects created by Ebenezer Isaac. Including their source code and documentation on how to it works.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is an area of computer science. It emphasises the creation of intelligent machines that work and react like humans. It is still believed to be in the development phase. But we can see implementations of Artificial Intelligence Projects around us in this digital age. Speech Recognition and Movie Recommendation are examples of them.

I tried my hands at Artificial Intelligence Projects as a hobby. I have shared source code to all of them. An introduction on how to replicate them easily has also been provided for each project.






Collection of Web Application Projects created by Ebenezer Isaac. Including their source code and documentation on how to it works.

Web Application Projects(Web Apps) have been with us for three decades. A Web Application is an application program that is stored on a remote server. So that it can be delivered over the Internet through a browser. Web Applications play an important role in information sharing and e-commerce.

I have worked on many Web Application Projects as a hobby. Information Sharing, Entity Management Systems and Phishing are the objectives of most these projects. I have shared source code to all of them. An introduction on how to replicate them easily has also been provided for each project.



About me….
Learning never exhausts the mind.

Hey, I am Ebenezer Isaac, a BCA student studying at Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda. I love learning and trying new technologies. And when I learning something, I start working on a random idea in my head. Some of them turn out into really interesting projects unlike others. But I think its more about the journey that the destination.

This website which also started as one of my projects gives me the exact platform to share all of those projects with you. It also helps me receive valuable feedback and new ideas to improve them. This website, is also my way of shouting out to the internet –

“I’m still alive!! ”
